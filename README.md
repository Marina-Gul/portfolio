## About Me
I am a passionate computer scientist with a deep interest in exploring the intersection of data structures, algorithms, and real-world applications. My journey in computer science has led me to delve into various domains, including big data clustering, Natural Language Processing (NLP), computational social science, and AI ethics. I thrive on solving complex problems and using technology to drive meaningful change in society.

## Research Interests
### Big Data Clustering: 
With a strong background in clustering large datasets, my MS thesis focused on developing efficient algorithms for big data. I am continually exploring new ways to enhance clustering techniques, particularly in the context of social science research.
<br>
###  Computational Social Science: 
I am committed to using data-driven methods to address social issues, uncover patterns in social behavior, and contribute to a deeper understanding of societal dynamics.
<br>
###  AI Ethics and Bias: 
As AI systems become increasingly integral to decision-making processes, I am dedicated to researching AI bias and network inequalities, ensuring that technology serves everyone equitably.
