# About Me
I am a passionate computer scientist with a deep interest in exploring the intersection of data structures, algorithms, and real-world applications. My journey in computer science has led me to delve into various domains, including big data clustering, Natural Language Processing (NLP), computational social science, and AI ethics. I thrive on solving complex problems and using technology to drive meaningful change in society.

# Research Interests
Natural Language Processing (NLP): I am particularly interested in how large language models can be applied to clustering and sentiment analysis. My research aims to push the boundaries of what NLP can achieve in understanding and processing human language.
<br>
Big Data Clustering: With a strong background in clustering large datasets, my MS thesis focused on developing efficient algorithms for big data. I am continually exploring new ways to enhance clustering techniques, particularly in the context of social science research.
<br>
Computational Social Science: I am committed to using data-driven methods to address social issues, uncover patterns in social behavior, and contribute to a deeper understanding of societal dynamics.
<br>
AI Ethics and Bias: As AI systems become increasingly integral to decision-making processes, I am dedicated to researching AI bias and network inequalities, ensuring that technology serves everyone equitably.
